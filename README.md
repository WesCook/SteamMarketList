# Steam Market List

Will return a list of URLs from any Steam Market emails in Gmail.  The messages will then be marked as read and archived automatically.  The URLs can be run through a tool like Postman to automate the network requests.  A Steam login cookie is required to verify the market transactions.

This script runs on the [Google App Script](https://script.google.com/home) engine.  It can also be imported into Cloud Platform for use in a private addon, though this is considerably more complicated to set up and will not have support provided for.
